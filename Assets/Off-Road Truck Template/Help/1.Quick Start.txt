Question 1 :  Can i use light mapping with this kit?

No... baking lights will remove the shadows on deformed terrain parts.
Because i have used terrain deformation at realtime, so you must use a realtime directional light as sun light... 
You can disable shadows to get the maximum performance for directional light
Already tested without performance lost on android devices
